(need png content added to index.html header)

- Need to verify register and login email regex is correct

- Add name to login/register form 

ONCE ACC SYSTEM IS WORKING:
- Consolidate css with DRY ie classes that span all pages

MUST HAVES:
- Search for a single word and return matching movies
- Search genres
- Select from the above, add to a personal list.
- Add your list to a group, rate/score the group movies
- Create a group watchlist in order


NICE TO HAVES LATER:
- Add password reset form/page
- Add password change form/page

(Send a password reset link to an email address)
- https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-resetpasswordforemail

(Update the users password)
- https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-updateuser

(Case where register user is already created - no feedback given)

(Create link to password reset in website for supabase)

(Allow next page on search results)

(create separate classes for login verify things like password format and is input null?)

verifyEmail.js needs to have the correct regex etc

if sign-up successful, show dialog or move to login screen

redirect pages to login screen if user has not been authed ie mylist, groups etc

when searching a new movie, the screen does not auto scroll back to the top

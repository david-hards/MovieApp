(need png content added to index.html header)

- Need to verify register and login email regex is correct

- Add name to login/register form 

ONCE ACC SYSTEM IS WORKING:
- Consolidate css with DRY ie classes that span all pages

MUST HAVES:
- Search for a single word and return matching movies
- Search genres
- Select from the above, add to a personal list.
- Add your list to a group, rate/score the group movies
- Create a group watchlist in order


NICE TO HAVES LATER:
- Add password reset form/page
- Add password change form/page

(Send a password reset link to an email address)
- https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-resetpasswordforemail

(Update the users password)
- https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-updateuser

(Case where register user is already created - no feedback given)

(Create link to password reset in website for supabase)

(Allow next page on search results)

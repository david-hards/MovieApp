(need png content added to index.html header)

- Need to verify register and login email regex is correct

- Add name to login/register form 

ONCE ACC SYSTEM IS WORKING:
- Consolidate js with DRY, ie hash password
- Consolidate css with DRY ie classes that span all pages

MUST HAVES:
- Search for a single word and return matching movies
- Search genres
- Select from the above, add to a personal list.
- Add your list to a group, rate/score the group movies
- Create a group watchlist in order


NICE TO HAVES LATER:
- Add password reset form/page
- Add password change form/page
